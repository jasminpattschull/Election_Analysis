## Challenge Overview and Summary

This challenge required the installation and use of Python and Visual Studio (VS) Code.  It was also requested to add, commit and push analysis results throughout the challenge via GitBash to GitHub. Mathematical equations were used to extract further information from the data file; Election Results. Upon determining who the candidates were, how many votes they each received (along with the respective percentages of the total votes each candidate received and, ultimately, the winner by popular vote the results were written to a .txt file to pass along with the final results.

I found Python to be easier to use than the prior VBA in Excel as it seems more intuitive.  Utilizing VS Code was extremely helpful to find errors quickly and the automatic color coding was quite handy as well.  I did find it tricky to ensure that my tabs are lined up properly, while VS Code makes it clear where the code is aligned on the left margin, I still needed to make sure I had it aligned properly or errors would result.  Additionally, I find that when troublesjooting, I can find myself in a bit of a mess and need to start my file over.  Not always are you able to use the Undo button and when you begin editing its easy to forget what you've edited.
